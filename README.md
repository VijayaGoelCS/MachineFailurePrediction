**Problem Statement** â€“ Predict the machine failure and its type.

**Objectives:** 
 a. Preprocess the data and make it suitable for prediction.
 b. Check for patterns in the distribution of values and any interrelationships between the variables. 
 c. Predict whether the machine will fail based on the given variables. 
 d. Predict the failure type of the machine. 

**Solution**

As a part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocess data to treat any nulls, duplicates, and outliers present in the data. 

Various visualization charts are drawn to identify patterns and chances of failure across the combination of different sets of features. 

Prediction of machine failure and its type is done using various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier.

**Significance of Analysis**
  1. By knowing the possibility of failures across different features, appropriate actions can be taken to reduce the failure rate of the machine. 
  2. Reasons for machine failure can be identified which can be taken care of to improve its productivity. 
  3. Consequently, the overall operation and maintenance process can be improved by knowing the machine failure rate.
